Net-Spotify

This module provides a simple interface to the Spotify Metadata API
<http://developer.spotify.com/en/metadata-api/overview/>.

The API allows to explore Spotify's music catalogue.
It is possible to lookup a specific Spotify URI and retrieve various
information about the resource it represents, and search for artists,
albums and tracks.

The output is in XML format.

Enjoy! :)
